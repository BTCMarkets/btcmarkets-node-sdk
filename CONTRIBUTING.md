# Contributing

BTC Markets welcomes contributions to our open source projects on Github. When contributing, please follow the guide below.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

Please refer to each project's style and contribution guidelines for submitting patches and additions. In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

1. Fork the repo on GitHub
2. Clone the project to your own machine
3. Commit changes to your own branch
4. Push your work back up to your fork
5. Submit a Pull request so that we can review your changes
   
NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!

### Versioning

Based on the commit messages, increment the version from the lastest release.

* If the string "BREAKING CHANGE" is found anywhere in any of the commit messages or descriptions the major version will be incremented.
* If a commit message begins with the string "feat" then the minor version will be increased. This works for most common commit metadata for feature additions: "feat: new API" and "feature: new API".
* All other changes will increment the patch version.
